          <p>The goal of the double bass database is to provide bassists 
          with a one-stop shop to look up music related to the double bass.
          This app will contain a databse including a list of solo (unaccompanied 
          and accompanied), duet, trio, and chamber music for the bass, along with the 
          composer name and length of piece. Users can also favorite pieces and create 
          their own list of double bass favorites, and add to the overall list with new pieces
          if they see that a piece they know is missing. </p>
